# Overview
The VeraCrypt add-in aims to provide accessability for mounting and dismounting virtual drives on demand.

We want to provide you with an easy to use drive management system, and not go too overboard. Security should be easy and intutive, so let us do the heavy lifting for you.

## Feature Wish-List
We can't provide all features at once. Below is a quick wish-list of basic feature we want to provide you from with-in

* Manage multiple drives
* Single click to mount drives
* Auto-sync (dis)mounted drive status in Shortcuts add-in
* Master password wrapper, so you don't have to recall each one while staying secure
* Auto-install VeraCrypt drivers
* Auto-discover previous install of VeraCrypt
* Drive creation wizard
* Auto-mount on app start
* Auto-dismount on system shutdown
* Auto-dismount on log-off
* Auto-dismount after x-minutes (_meh?_)
* Set encryption methods/strength for storing passwords

## Short-term To-do
* [ ] SysTray's ``target`` use a GUID index from ToolsHub settings to link to the .HC file
